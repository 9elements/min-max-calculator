At [9elements](https://9elements.com), we use [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi) in many of our projects to create fluid scales for type and spacing without writing media queries. Even on this website that you’re visiting right now, we use a type scale generated by the handy tool created by [James Gilyead](https://www.hustlersquad.net/) & [Trys Mudford](https://www.trysmudford.com/). You might have guessed it already – we love Utopia!

Sometimes you don’t need a whole token system but a single interpolation between two values in a viewport range. That’s why we created this tool to help you with just that.
Bonus: You may use negative values for the min-value. That may be needed in rare situations for margins or absolute positioning.
